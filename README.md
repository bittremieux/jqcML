# jqcML

jqcML is a Java application programming interface (API) for the qcML standard.

Firstly, jqcML provides a complete object model to represent qcML data. Secondly, jqcML provides the ability to read, write and work in a uniform manner with qcML data from different sources, including the XML-based qcML file format and the relational database qcDB. Interaction with the XML-based file format is obtained through the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB), while generic database functionality is obtained by the Java Persistence API (JPA).

jqcML is made available under the permissive Apache 2.0 open-source license. If you use jqcML as part of your work, please cite the following publication:
